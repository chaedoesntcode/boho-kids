This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## The Approach

My objective for this project was to develop a visually captivating landing page. Informed by a design mockup created in Figma based on client needs, I utilized Next.js for server-side rendering and components, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, complemented by custom CSS and JavaScript for finer-grained styling and interactivity.
